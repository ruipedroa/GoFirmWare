# GoFirmWare
Project for Ubiwhere

Project Developed in GO Language for an embedded system communcation with external devices and management of a Database.

The project can successfully do:
  1. Write OS system CPU and RAM usage to a local DB
  2. Save random values to the local DB, simulating external device variables
  3. Implement search queries to get last n values from varaibles stored in DB
  4. Retrieve average value from varaibles stored.

Features to be added:
  1. Threads must be added to ensure the application can interact with user and collect values at the same time.
  2. Simulator and communications using gRPC 
  3. Improve memory management.
  4. Organize code for easier read.
